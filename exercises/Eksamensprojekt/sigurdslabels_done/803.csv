"""See that star moving across the night sky? That's a grown stellacorn. While the young ones lend us their healing magic until they can be returned to the sky, grown stellacorns can wield that power on their own. It is considered very lucky to see one and know it for what it is. Luckier still to care for one."" - Lidari, Keeper of the Stars"
