    "### Modules and Packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuse of code in Jupyter notebooks can be done by either including a raw python source as a magic command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%load filename.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "but this just pastes the source into the notebook and creates all kinds of pains regarding code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way is to use a python __module__. A module consists simply (and pythonic) of a directory with a module init file in it (possibly empty) \n",
    "```python\n",
    "libitmal/__init__.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "To this directory you can add modules in form of plain python files, say\n",
    "```python\n",
    "libitmal/utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's about it! The `libitmal` file tree should now look like\n",
    "```\n",
    "libitmal/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "├── __pycache__\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.cpython-36.pyc\n",
    "│   └── utils.cpython-36.pyc\n",
    "├── utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "with the cache part only being present once the module has been initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to use the `libitmal` unit via an import directive, like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from libitmal import utils as itmalutils\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dir(itmalutils))\n",
    "print(itmalutils.__file__)\n",
    "\n",
    "X = np.array([[1,2],[3,-100]])\n",
    "itmalutils.PrintMatrix(X,\"mylabel=\")\n",
    "itmalutils.TestAll()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qa Load and test the `libitmal` module\n",
    "\n",
    "Try out the `libitmal` module from [GITMAL]. Load this module and run the function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from libitmal import utils as itmalutils\n",
    "itmalutils.TestAll()\n",
    "```\n",
    "from this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a python module ___include___ search path, that you may have to investigate and modify. For my Linux setup I have an export or declare statement in my .bashrc file, like\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "declare -x PYTHONPATH=~/ASE/ML/itmal:$PYTHONPATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "but your ```itmal```, the [GITMAL] root dir, may be placed elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ___Windows___, you have to add `PYTHONPATH` to your user environment variables...see screenshot below (enlarge by modding the image width-tag or find the original png in the Figs directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://itundervisning.ase.au.dk/SWMAL/L01/Figs/Screenshot_windows_enviroment_variables.png\" alt=\"WARNING: could not get image from server.\" style=\"height:250px\" style=\"width:350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "or if you, like me, hate setting up things in a GUI, and prefer a console, try in a CMD on windows\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "CMD> setx.exe PYTHONPATH \"C:\\Users\\auXXYYZZ\\itmal\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "replacing the username and path with whatever you have. Note that some Windows installations have various security settings enables, so that running `setx.exe` fails. Setting up a MAC should be similar to Linux; just modify your `PYTHONPATH` setting (still to be proven correct?, CEF). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything fails you could programmatically add your path to the libitmal directory as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys,os\n",
    "sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('~/itmal'))\n",
    "\n",
    "from libitmal import utils as itmalutils\n",
    "print(dir(itmalutils))\n",
    "print(itmalutils.__file__)\n",
    "```\n",
